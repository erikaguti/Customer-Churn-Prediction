# Customer Churn Prediction Using Tree Based Models

This project was done in collaboration with [David Gayan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/davidgadyan/) and Wang Chunfeng as part of the Barcelona School of Economics's Computational Machine Learning module. 

We were tasked with developing an algorithm that can predict if a customer will cancel their service (aka churn). We are given a dataset containing telecommunication information of 3,333 customers with the following features:

- Churn (target): 1 if customer cancelled service, 0 if not
- AccountWeeks: number of weeks customer has had active account
- ContractRenewal: 1 if customer recently renewed contract, 0 if not
- DataPlan: 1 if customer has data plan, 0 if not
- DataUsage: gigabytes of monthly data usage
- CustServCalls: number of calls into customer service
- DayMins: average daytime minutes per month
- DayCalls: average number of daytime calls
- MonthlyCharge: average monthly bill
- OverageFee: largest overage fee in last 12 months
- RoamMins: average number of roaming minutes

15% of these customers had churned.

We used decision tree based algorithms to accomplish the task. Their results are below:

| Model  | AUC | Accuracy |
| ------------- | ------------- | | ------------- |
| Random Forest Classifier  | Content Cell  | | Content Cell  |
| XGBOOST Classifer  | Content Cell  | | Content Cell  |

These metrics show that .....

Based on the X model the features driving churn the most are ....
